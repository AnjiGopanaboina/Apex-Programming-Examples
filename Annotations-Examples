Annotations:
1.Annotations are keywords that start with  ‘@’ symbol and convey a special meaning to the server to treat the code in a different way.
2.Annotations are additional descriptions given to a class or a method.
      Purpose: Server to treat the components in different way.
3.When we specify the Class with “@” symbol then the behavior of the regular controller class,will changes to Test class .Whatever we write inside the Test
class will not fallow the "governor limits" and this would not reflect in the model.

Note: While creating a method in APex test class, testMethod keyword is very important to declare not the main method. In Salesforce main method can be replaced with
any method name because execution of the test class will begin from the testMethod keyword.

1.@isTest Annotation: To differentiate Business class with Test Class

@isTest
public class SampleTest{
    public static testmethod void main(){
        
    }
}

2.@TestVisible Annotations : To access private data members in the Apex class.

Apex Class:

public class sampleClass {
    @TestVisible private Integer num;
}

Apex Test Class:

@isTest
public class sampleClassTest {
    public static testmethod void main(){
        sampleClass s = new sampleClass();
        s.num = 89;
    }
}

3.@future Annotayion: This is an Asynchronous process which will execute in the background.
