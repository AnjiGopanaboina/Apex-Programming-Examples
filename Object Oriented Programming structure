                                                                  Object Oriented Programming Structure (OOPS)
                                                                  --------------------------------------------
It is a concept that deals with 4 features
        a.Abstraction
        b.Encapsulation
        c.Inheritance
        d.Polymorphism
        
1.Abstraction: levels of hiding the programming elements.
-------------
2.Encapsulation: binding of programming elements.
---------------
3.Inheritance: Reusability of Programming elements.
-------------
4.Polymorphism: Mutliple behaviours of programming elements.
--------------

Note:Any programming language that deals with these four features are known as Programming driven archicture. Note: Apex uses OOPS structure.

                                                                        -------------
Levels of binding the programming elements 
				2 keywords 
				    a.Interface 
				    b.Class
Interface: It is a collection of method prototype only 
---------
	Syntax: 
  ------
  Datatypeoftheresult  methodName (input pa...., input pa); 

Note: When you are writing a method, Every word First letter should be Lower case and there after every word first letter should be upper case.
----
	
Class: Class has four definitions
-----
			a.It is a blueprint of Real world existance.
			b.It is nothing but collection of features and bahaviour.
			c.class is a collection of data members and member methods 
			d.It is an user defined datatype.
	
Note: datamembers represents memory statements and memberMethods represents Functions or method
----
Example: if you want to construct a house? You need a Plan right?
Like How many bedrooms, Kitchen,Hall..etc:: This represents the Structure Where we call that a Plan where Engineer will desing on the Piece of Paper:: Refered to Class
By using the design we construct the house In RealTime right? That realtime Construction of the House::  Refered to the Object
                        Design :: Class
                        Realtime : Object
Example:Book
-------
      Feature:Pages,Author,Bookname,Cover page,Edition
			Behaviours :Chapters,Index
														
Syntax:
------
Class ClassName{
					//features or data members
					//behaviours or member methods
					 }

Note: While writing the class Every word first letter should be Upper case only.
-----

Example:
-------
Class Mobile{
    //features 
        String Company;
        decimal Speed;
        Integer length;
        integer screenLength;
        
        // behaviour 
        Datatypeoftheresult MakaaCall(String Name, Double MobileNumber){
            //set of statements::Perfrom a well defined task;
        }
}

Note:
----
In Interface :: We use Prototype 
In Class :: We use Defination

Note:Every member method must provide services to data members. 
----

Q) How to mark the features or data members?
		Features are those characterstics in which we can use them to identify in the realworld existance only.

Q) What are the uses of Method or Function?
    Method performs a well defined task when it is called by its name and suitable inputs

There are 4 different types of memberMethods
		a.Create
		b.Input
		c.Action/process
		d.Output
