Q) What are Email services?
    Email services are automated processes that use Apex classes to process the contents, headers, and attachments of inbound email.You can associate each email service
    with one or more Salesforce-generated email addresses to which users can send messages for processing.

There are two types of Email Services:
  1.Outbound Email Services : Salesforce to Outside email
  2.InBound Email Services : Outside Email to Salesforce
  
Outbound Email Service:
----------------------
        Suppose you want to send an email to your friend, for that you need ToAddress, ccAddress, Subject, Body and Attachments, similarly, In order to send an email
using Apex in Salesforce, we have a pre defined class called Messaging.SingleEmailMessage.

Apex Class Name : Messaging.SingleEMailMessage
Object Creation:  Messaging.SingleEMailMessage msg = new Messaging.SingleEMailMessage();

Apex Methods:
       1.setToAddress();              : In this method we will pass email's of those whom you want to send.
       2.setSubject();                : In this method we need to pass Subject of the email.
       3.setPlaintextBody();          : In this method we need to pass Body of the email.
       4.setAttachments();            : if we want to attach some documents then we use this method.
Once everything is ready, Create a new object for Messaging email (as shown below) class and add Single Email Message to that list
        List<Messaging.Email> emaillst = new List<Messaging.Email>();
        emaillst.add(msg);
Now In order to send emails we need to use the method : Messaging.sendEmail

Apex Class:
-----------


Execute the below code in Anyonimous Window:
--------------------------------------------
OutboundEmailExample outemail = new OutboundEmailExample();
outemail.sendEmail();
