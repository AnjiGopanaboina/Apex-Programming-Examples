Development Interview Questions:
-------------------------------

Q) What is Apex?
i) Apex is a Salesforce proprietary programming language Which can be used only on Salesforce platform to build complex logics.
ii)Apex is strongly typed object oriented programming structure that allows developers to execute code on Salesforce platoform
iii)Apex programming allows developers to write code to call an API (Application programming interface)
iv) Using Apex we can build complex business logics to most system events, including button clicks, related records updates and many more....

Q) When should we use Apex?
i) Create web services
ii) create email services
iii) Perform complex validations over mutliple objects
iv) Create complex business logics that are supported by the automation tools like Workflows, Process builder and Flows

Q) What are different types of datatypes available in Apex?
i)Primitive
ii)Collection
iii)S-object
iv) Enum

Q)What are Primitive datatypes?
A) Integer, decimal, double, Boolean, date, Time, DateTime, string, Long and ID

Q)What are collection in Apex?
A) List, Set and Map

Q) What is S-object datatype?
A) S-object refers to any object (both Standard and Custom objects) can be stored data in the Salesforce platform database.

Q) How to access the fields from the S-object
A) Contact con = new Contact();
   con.lastName = 'Anji';
   con.firstName = 'Gopanaboina';
   insert con;

Q) What is the difference between single DML vs Bulk DML operation?
A) Updating one record at a time is single DML where as updating mutliple records using list of S-object is Bulk DML operation

Single DML:
   Contact con = new Contact();
   con.lastName = 'Anji';
   con.firstName = 'Gopanaboina';
   insert con;
   
Bulk DML:
  Contact con = new Contact();
  list<Contact> lstcon = new list<Contact>();
  con.lastName = 'Anji';
  con.firstName = 'Gopanaboina';
  lstcon.add(con);
  con.lastName = 'Test';
  con.firstName = 'Record';
  lstcon.add(con);
  insert lstcon;
  
Note: Always perform DMl operation to avoid hitting governor limit

Q)Difference between DML statements vs database class methods?
A) Apex perfoms DML operations in 2 ways
      i)using DML operations: insert, update, delete, undelete, merge,upsert
        if one record fails in the transcation then DMl will fail for the entire transcation
      ii)using database class methods:
        if one record fail in the transcation then only that record will fail not the entire transcation (partial execution will be done).
 Example 1:
   Contact con = new Contact();
   con.lastName = 'Anji';
   con.firstName = 'Gopanaboina';
   insert con;
   
  Contact con = new Contact();
  con.lastName = 'Test';
  con.firstName = 'Record';
  insert con;
   
  Example 2:
  
  list<Contact> lstcon = new list<Contact>();
  lstcon.add(new contact(name='Anji Gopanaboina'));
  lstcon.add(new contact(name='Test record'));
  Database.saveResult[] srlist = database.insert(lstcon,false)

Q)Why do we use transcational control statements? 
A) we use transcational control statements in a scenario where we are executing multiple DML statements and we want to rollback all the DML's if one DML fails.

Use case: If you want to insert contact as soon as Account is inserted, let's say you want if contact record insertion fails, then we dont want account also to insert.

Q)What are transcational control statements?
A) Database.savepoint and database.rollback
Note: first write Database.savepoint and write your logic and  then database.rollback if you wish to rollback your code.
      These are available in the Database class

Q) Example for transcational control statements?
A) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9lH2lHkIQ0
Account acc = new Account(name = 'Test record');

//create a savepoint where AccountNumber is Null
savepoint sp = database.setSavepoint();

//change the account number
acc.AccountNumber = '123';
update acc;

//rollback to the previous null value
database.rollback(sp);

Q)What is mixed DML errors in Salesforce?
  When you try to perform DML operation on both setup and non-setup object in the same transcation then we face mixed DML operation.
  
Example: Inserting an Account record and user with role record with in the same transcation.

Q) What are setup and Non-setup object in salesforce?
A) https://www.forcetalks.com/salesforce-topic/what-are-the-setup-and-non-setup-object/#:~:text=Hi%20Saddam%2C,category%20of%20Non%2DSetup%20Objects
   Setup Object is:  1.Profiles   2.Users   3.Record Type
   Non-Setup Object :1.Lead       2.Account 3.Contact  5.Any Custom Object
   
Q) Can you tell me few objects that will not support DML operations?
A) There are few standard objects which are also known as system objects which does not support DML operation like BusinessHours, Business process and categoryNode,
   currencyType, DatedConversionRate, ProcessInstance,Profile, RecordType, SelfServiceUser,StaticResources, Teritory2 etc.
   
Q) What is record locking or locking statement in Apex?
A)
