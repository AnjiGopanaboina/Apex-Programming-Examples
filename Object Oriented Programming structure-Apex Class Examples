Class:
    a.It is a collection of datamembers and member methods 
            Datamembers are defined as features
            memberMethods are defined as behaviours.
    b.Class is a user defined Data-type
    c.Class is a blue print of real world existance
 
Syntax:
 class ClassName {
    //features or data members;
    //behaviours or memberMethods;
}

Examples:
1.Create a class Student with name,phone and age?

class Student {
    string name;
    String phone;
    Integer age;
}

2.Create a class Employee with lastName,firstName,exp and salary?

class Employee{
    String lastName;
    String firstName;
    Decimal exp;
    Decimal salary;
}

3.Create a class Employee with lastName,firstName,exp and salary and Create a Display method which will print the lastName,firstName,exp and salary?

class Employee{
    String lastName;
    String firstName;
    Decimal exp;
    Decimal salary;
    void display(){
        System.debug(lastName);
        System.debug(firstName);	
        System.debug(exp);
        System.debug(salary);
    }
}

4.Create a class Employee with lastName,firstName,exp and salary  and create a method setData whcih will set the data lastName=Gopanaboina, firstName=Anji and Exp=5?

class Employee {
    String lastName;
    String firstName;
    Decimal exp;
    Decimal salary;
    void setData(){
        lastName='Anji';
        firstName='Gopanaboina';
        exp=5;
    }
}

5.Create a class Employee with lastName,firstName,exp,salary and Create a method setData which will set data lastName as Anji, firstName as Gopana, exp as 5 
 and salary : if exp > 5 then salary is 50k else 30k Create a method display which will print the data?
 
class Employee {
    String lastName;
    String firstName;
    Decimal exp;
    Decimal salary;
    void setData(){
        lastName='Anji';
        firstName='Gopanaboina';
        exp=5;
        if(exp>5){
            salary=50000;
        }else{
            salary=30000;
        }
    }
    void display(){
        System.debug(firstName);
        System.debug(lastName);
        System.debug(salary);
        System.debug(exp);
    }
}

What is the Structure of Apex Programming?
	Every apex program must be a encapsulation or ClassName
	Apex classes are catogerised into 2 types.
		    1.Business class
            2.Test Class
Business Class: This is where we write the actual logic of the program

Syntax:
Class ClassName{
    //Data members 
    // member methods
}

Test Class: Test Class is used to test the behavoiur of business class

@isTest
Class ClassNameTest{
    //Data members 
    // member methods
}

Q)How to distinguish between business class and test class?
A)Append the class with word Test and use @isTest annotation on top of the class

Q) Steps to write a class or Test Class?
A)On the setup Navigation => Click on Developer Console => Goto File => New => Apex  Class => Name of the Apex class

Q) Where does the execution of the program will start ?
A) THe execution of the program will always start from the test class only by just clicking on "Runtest"  button.

Q)How to call the business class inside the Test Class ?	
	By creating an object for the business class.

Q) What is object?
    1.It is a instance of a class.
Syntax: 
    a. Step 1: new keyword will create a object 
    b. Step 2: Once the object is created by new then constructor will be fired and it will initialize the datamembers .
    c. Refference varaible will be created for the class to reffer to the object created using new keyword.
    d. generally we call refference variable as object.
    
    ClassName objectName =  new ClassName();
       |	       |	     |    |
       c	       d	     a	  b
 Q)What is the syntax to define an object for a business class?
		ClassName    objectName    =  new  ClassName();
        
 Q) How to call memberMethods inside a Test class. 
        objectname.methodname;
 
 Q) How does the Apex class will determine its difference from test class to business class?
	By defining an Annotation called : @isTest

Note : In apex programming the program execution will not start from the main method but from the testMethod keyword

Q) What is the initial state of any data member?
	    Null (Nothing not even '0') 

The execution of the program will take place from the test class only.
