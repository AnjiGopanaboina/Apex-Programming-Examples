Schedule Apex:
  1. If you want to run Apex classes at a specific time then we use schedule apex .
  2. If you want to schedule Apex class,then apex class has to implement schedulable Interface

Example:
public class Example implements Schedulable{  }

3. Any Apex class which implements Schedulable Interface has to define execute method .

Example:
public void execute( SchedulableContext sc){
		
}

4. Operation or Logic which you want to schedule should be defined with in the execute method.

5. If want to schedule the class we have to define time trigger /cronExpression in the form of 	
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			SECS	MINS		HRS		DAY_MONTH 	MONTH_YEAR	DAY_WEEK	YEAR
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Symbol		 Meaning
-------------------------
*	Every (Every day,Every Month ,Every hour ,Every Min)
L	Last ( Last Day  ,Last Month , Last firday )
W	Nearest Working Day
?	Not sure 
,	3,5,7 ( every 3rd ,5th ,7th)

6. How to schedule the job .
	Id jobId=System.schedule(jobName, cronExpression,object) ;
	
a. JobName:It can be any unique string 
b. CronExpression : Time at which the job has to fire 
c. Object: object of the class which implemented the schedulable interface should be passed as parameter.
Example :
	ScheduleExample se=new ScheduleExample();
	String expression=' 0  30  6   15   3   ? ';
	Id jobId=System.schedule('DataCleaning', expression,se);

7. Any job that is scheduled in the salesforce will be registred CRONTRIGGER object .

8. If you want to know the status of the job we can write a soql on CronTriger object using jobId generated by system.schedule() method invocation.
    CronTrigger cron=[select id,cronExpression from CronTrigger where id=:jobId ];

9. We can also schedule apex class manually  using declarative process.
