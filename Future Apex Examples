Synchronous process: It means the operations will execute immediatly.
Ex: Process Builder, Workflow action, validation rules

Asynchronous Process: It means the operations will not execute immediatly. It will execute in the background

Asychronous Apex Types:
----------------------
  1. @Future
  2.Batch Apex
  3.Schedule Apex
  4.Queuable Apex

@Future:
-------
1.Future method must be Static
2.Future method return type is void
3.We cannot pass S-object as parameter for any future method (If in case if you have requirement as such pass id as parameter)
Example for the above statement: List<SObject>

For suppose assume that I want to update account record using future apex.If I define the same it will execute in future (it will be in the Queue) and now assume that
now I am updating the Phone value from 9999122343 to 123656743
List<Account> lstAcc =
