Note:
1. Number of DML rows we can perform on a single transcation is : 10K records
2. Number of records we can process using import wizard is : 50k records
3. Number of records we can process using Data loader is : 5 Million records

                                                                          Batch Apex

        1.When you want to process large number of records on daily basis or specific time in a day or weekly or monthly then there is a possibilty of encountering 
	  the governing limits.
   
	2.To resolve the governing limits issue ,we will run the operation as asynchronous operation using batch apex.
  
	3.Batch Apex is exposed as an interface that must be implemented by the developer. Batch jobs can be programmatically invoked at runtime using Apex.
	  
	4.Batch Apex  will break the larger set of records into no of batches with small set of data and every batch will run independent from each other with fresh set of 
	  governing limits. 
	
	5. If you want any Apex class to run like Batch Apex,That Apex class has to implement an Interface called:: database.Batchable interface .
	   
	6. Any Apex class which implements Database.Batchable interaface should define three methods
		          a.Start 
		          b.Execute
		          c.Finish
	7.start :
		a. This method will be called at the starting of the Batch Job and collects the data on which the Batch job need to be operated.
			 
		b.Syntax : Database.QueryLocator |Iterable<SObject> start(Database.BatchableContext bc){}
		
		c.Database.QueryLocator : It will support 50 Million records
		  
		e.Iterable: If you use Iterable then it is still under Governor Limits only (We will use this in rear cases only like when you want to get data from 
		   different objects and the update accordingly we will use Iterable).

		f.Start method will break the list of records into no of batches and invoke the execute method on every batch
		
		g.Database.BatchableContext: This is used to track the status of the Job
		
	8. execute: 
		a. This method will be invoked by the start method on every batch of recods.
    
		b. This method will contain business logic that need to performed on the records fetched from the start method .
		   
		c.Syntax : void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc,List<Sobject> scope)
		
		d.List<Sobject> contains the list of records in the batch job on which this execute method is running .
		 
		e. Example : If the start method fetched 1000 records and divided them into five batches with 200 records in each batch.Then execute method will be 
		   called on every batch separatly(execute method will be called 5 times);
			  		  
	9.finish :
		a. This method will be called after executing all the execute method.
    
		b. This method is used to send confirmation emails or post batch operations.
    
		c. Syntax :  void finish(Database.BatchableContext)
    
    		d. The other use of Batch Apex is We can call another Batch Apex inside Finish method.
	
Example 1: Fetch all the opportunity which are created today and with with stagename as closed won and update their closeDate as closed won.
	
Note: As Per my organization in day 15,000 to 20,000 opportunity records which will be closed. According to governing limits we can only perform DML operation on 
      10,000 records with in a transaction ,so we are choosing batch apex to handle this operation.

Example 1: I want to fetch all Accounts and update the description through Batch Apex?

Batch Apex Class:

public class BatchApexExample implements Database.Batchable<sObject>{
    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext bc){
        system.debug('Start Method');
        return Database.getQueryLocator([select id,Name,Phone,Description from Account]);
    }
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc , List<Account> lstacc){
        system.debug('Execute Method');
        for(Account acc : lstacc){
            acc.description = 'Account description updated successfully through batch Apex';
        }
        update lstacc;
    }
    
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc){
        system.debug('Finish Method');
        AsyncApexJob a = [SELECT Id, Status, NumberOfErrors, JobItemsProcessed,
                          TotalJobItems, CreatedBy.Email
                          FROM AsyncApexJob WHERE Id =:bc.getJobId()];
        Messaging.SingleEmailMessage mail = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
        String[] toAddresses = new String[] {'anji.gopanaboina@gmail.com'};
            mail.setToAddresses(toAddresses);
        mail.setSubject('Apex Sharing Recalculation ' + a.Status);
        mail.setPlainTextBody('The batch Apex job processed ' + a.TotalJobItems +' batches with '+ a.NumberOfErrors + ' failures.');
        Messaging.sendEmail(new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[] { mail });
    }
}

Execute the below code in Anonymous window:
BatchApexExample be = new BatchApexExample();
id jobId = Database.executeBatch(be, 150);
system.debug('jobId ::' + jobId);

Batch Apex : Finish method email notification example

Q) How many ways we can call the Batch Apex?
   Through Schedule Apex, Through Triggers, through Apex class, through controllers, through Anonymous window.

Note: In order to execute the Batch class we need to use Database.execute(BatchclassObjectName, Batch size)

Requirement: When an Opportunity is Closed Won, then create a new Opportunity with same information name OpportunityName_cloned and stage Name = Prospecting?
