Connected Apps:
  It is a framework that enables an external application to interact with Salesforce
  It accepts different protocols like SAML, openID connect and OAuth.
  In our module we will focus of OAuth enabled connected App for connecting external systems with Salesforce API.
  OAuth (Open Authorization) is a token-based protocol for Authorization.
  
OAuth Parameters:
    i) Client_id: It is a consumer key to identify itself to Salesforce.
    ii) Client_secret: It is a consumer secret to establish the ownership of the Client_id
    iii) Callback_URL: This URL is invoked after the OAuth authorization.
    iv) Access Token: Salesforce will share the Access Token to the client to access its resources once the Authorization is successful.
    v) Username: Profile User Name.
    vi) Password: It should be used along with the security Token.
    
What is security Token?
  It is utilized along with password to access the Salesforce API.
    Password = Password + Security Token

Create connected App :
  Quick find : App Manager => New Connected App => Connected App Name       : Consumer connect
                                                   API Name                 : Consumer_connect
                                                   Contact Email            : anji.presentation@gmail.com
                                                   Enable OAuth setting     : Enable
                                                   Callback URL             : https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/callback
                                                   Selected OAuth Scopes    : Full Access
                                                   Save
                                                   Manage
Under API (Enable OAuth settings) section click on Manage consumer details button
Verification code is sent via registered Email id
Verify
Consumer Key: It will be generated automatically
Consumer secret: It will be generated automatically

Note: Save both Consumer key and Consumer secret in a Notepad file (These two values are used when client wants to use Salesforce).
When client request to Salesforce we should provide Consumer key, COnsumer secret along with UserName and Password then Salesforce will authorize
