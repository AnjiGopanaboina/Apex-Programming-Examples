Object Oriented Programming Structure (OOPS): It is a concept that deals with 4 features

i.Abstraction: levels of hiding the programming elements.
ii.Encapsulation: binding of programming elements.
iii.Inheritance: Reusability of Programming elements.
iv.Polymorphism: Mutliple behaviours of programming elements.

Note:Any programming language that deals with these four features are known as Programming driven archicture.
     Apex uses OOPS structure.
                                                                        
Encapsulation: Levels of binding the programming elements 
		2 keywords 
			i.Interface 
			ii.Class

Interface: It is a collection of method prototype only 

Syntax: 
      Datatypeoftheresult  methodName (input pa...., input pa); 

Note: When you are writing a method, Every word First letter should be Lower case and there after every word first letter should be upper case.
	
Class: Class has four definitions
	i.It is a blueprint of Real world existance.
	ii.It is nothing but collection of features and bahaviour.
	iii.class is a collection of data members and member methods 
	iv.It is an user defined datatype.
	
Note: datamembers represents memory statements and memberMethods represents Functions or method.

Example: if you want to construct a house? You need a Plan right?

Like How many bedrooms, Kitchen,Hall..etc:: This represents the Structure Where we call that a Plan where Engineer will desing on the Piece of Paper:: Refered to Class
By using the design we construct the house In RealTime right? That realtime Construction of the House::  Refered to the Object
                        Design :: Class
                        Realtime : Object
Example: Book Class
         Feature:Pages,Author,Bookname,Cover page,Edition
         Behaviours :Chapters,Index
														
Syntax:
Class ClassName{
   //features or data members
  //behaviours or member methods
}

Note: While writing the class Every word first letter should be Upper case only.

Example:
Class Mobile{
    //features 
        String Company;
        decimal Speed;
        Integer length;
        integer screenLength;
        
        // behaviour 
        Datatypeoftheresult MakaaCall(String Name, Double MobileNumber){
            //set of statements::Perfrom a well defined task;
        }
}

Note:
In Interface :: We use Prototypes
In Class :: We use Defination

Note:Every member method must provide services to data members. 

Q) How to mark the features or data members?
		Features are those characterstics in which we can use them to identify in the realworld existance only.

Q) What are the uses of Method or Function?
    Method performs a well defined task when it is called by its name and suitable inputs

There are 4 different types of memberMethods
		a.Create
		b.Input
		c.Action/process
		d.Output
		
Q) What is the Structure of Apex Programming?
	Every apex program must be a encapsulation or ClassName
	Apex classes are catogerised into 2 types.
		    1.Business class
            	    2.Test Class

Business Class: This is where we write the actual logic of the program
Syntax:
	Class ClassName{
    		//Data members 
    		// member methods
	}

Test Class: Test Class is used to test the behavoiur of business class
Syntax:
	@isTest
	Class ClassNameTest{
    		//Data members 
    		// member methods
	}

Q)How to distinguish between business class and test class?
A)Append the class with word Test and use @isTest annotation on top of the class

Q) Steps to create a class and Test Class?
A)On the setup Navigation => Click on Developer Console => Goto File => New => Apex  Class => Name of the Apex class

Q) Where does the execution of the program will start ?
A) THe execution of the program will always start from the test class only by just clicking on "Runtest"  button.

Q)How to call the business class inside the Test Class ?	
	By creating an object for the business class.

Q) What is object?
    1.It is a instance of a class.

Syntax: 
    a. Step 1: new keyword will create a object 
    b. Step 2: Once the object is created by new then constructor will be fired and it will initialize the datamembers .
    c. Refference varaible will be created for the class to reffer to the object created using new keyword.
    d. generally we call refference variable as object.
    
    ClassName objectName =  new ClassName();
       |	   |	     |    |
       c	   d	     a	  b
Q)What is the syntax to define an object for a business class?
	ClassName    objectName    =  new  ClassName();
        
Q) How to call memberMethods inside a Test class. 
        objectname.methodname;
 
Q) How does the Apex class will determine its difference from test class to business class?
	By defining an Annotation called : @isTest

Note : In apex programming the program execution will not start from the main method but from the testMethod keyword

Q) What is the initial state of any data member?
	Null (Nothing not even '0') 

Note: The execution of the program will take place from the test class only.
