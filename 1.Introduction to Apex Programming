i.Apex is an High level language.
ii. How Apex Programming language is similar to Natural Language?

        Natural Level Language	            High Level Language
              Paragraph	                        Program
              Sentences	                        Statements
              Words	                        Syntax
              Grammar	                        Tokens
Tokens:
i.A smallest unit of a program that conveys a meaning 
ii.These tokens are categorized into 5 types

1.Keyword: Keywords is a word which has a well-defined meaning and its meaning cannot be changed from program to program.
    Ex: Integer, String, Decimal, Double, Float................Etc.,
    
2.Identifier: Identifiers are the words in which its meaning can be changed from program to program.
		Ex: Integer x;
‘X’ is an Identifier which holds both positive and negative values.
		Ex: String x;
‘X’ is an Identifier which holds both Numbers and Character.
 
 Integer                x                  =                       10;
//Keyword          Identifier     Assignment Operator   Literal/constant

String			x	           =		      'Test123';
//Keyword          Identifier     Assignment Operator  	       String

So by this we can conclude Identifier meaning can be changed from Program to Program.

3.Operators: These are the symbols that perform a well-defined task.
		Ex: 5 + 7 => 12
Operators are of 3 types

Unary: One value one operator:
     sqrt(25)  (or)        3! 
     OP value   (or)      Value OP 

Binary: Two values one or more Operators:  
                      sqrt(25) + sqrt(36)
    		     OP Value1 + OP value2 
    			    (Or)
    		     Value1 OP + Value2 OP
Ternary: Three are more values and operator: BODMAS Rules
    		Ex: Quadratic equations
       
4.String: Collection of Alpha Numeric characters 
		Ex: French, Italy, London123, SF Training…Etc., 

5.Literals/Constant: These are constant values 
		Ex: 5, 6, 8, 7, 7.8, -3.4.........Etc.,
