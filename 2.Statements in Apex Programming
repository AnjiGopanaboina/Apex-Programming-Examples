Statements in Apex Programming language:

1.Input statements	: In Apex there are no input statements.
2.Output statements: In Apex there is no output statements.
System.debug(): Which is used to print the content in the "Log file".

This System.Debug can exist in three modes

i.Only Value
  Ex: System.debug(12);

ii.Only Message
	Ex: System.debug('Hi welcome to Salesforce');

iii.Value + Message
	Ex: System.Debug('Hai welcome to Salesforce' + 12);

Note: For input and output statements in apex we use an XML (Extended Markup language) Language: Visualforce/Lightning/LWC.

3.Memory statement: Allocates memory (RAM)
        Integer, string, Decimal, Double, Bolb, Date, DateTime, Time, Long, Boolean
        
4.ALU Statements: ALU statements stands for Arthematic and logical statements
                    i.Assignment Operator: =
                    ii.Relational Operator: >,<,>=,<=,==,!=,

Integer Integer ====> No

Naming Convention::

1.Upper Camel:
	In this naming convention, every word first letter should be capital.
	This naming convention is used to define names for Class and Interface
Example: 
	Student, Invoice_Data, Employee_Info

2.Lower Camel: 
	In this naming convention, first word first letter should be small and every word first letter should be capital
	This naming convention is used to define names for methods and variables.
Example:
    	setName, invokeData, getData, callMe, getStudentData

3.Upper Case: 
    	In this naming convention every word every letter should be capital.
    	This is used for defining names for Constants.
Example:
    	MAX_AGE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_AMOUNT, DML_EXCEPTION

4.Lower Case
	In this naming convention every word, every letter should be small.
    	This is used to define names for keywords and packages.
Example:
	for, if, while, for each loopâ€¦Etc.,
