Statements in Apex Programming language:

1.Input statements	: In Apex there are no input statements.
2.Output statements: In Apex there is no output statements.
System.debug(): Which is used to print the content in the "Log file".

This System.Debug can exist in three modes

i.Only Value
  Ex: System.debug(12);

ii.Only Message
	Ex: System.debug('Hi welcome to Salesforce');

iii.Value + Message
	Ex: System.Debug('Hai welcome to Salesforce' + 12);

Note: For input and output statements in apex we use an XML (Extended Markup language) Language: Visualforce/Lightning/LWC.

3.Memory statement: Allocates memory (RAM)
        Integer, string, Decimal, Double, Bolb, Date, DateTime, Time, Long, Boolean
        
4.ALU Statements: ALU statements stands for Arthematic and logical statements
                    i.Assignment Operator: =
                    ii.Relational Operator: >,<,>=,<=,==,!=,

Rules to define Identifiers or variables:
	i.Length should be 1 to 256 characters only.
	ii.A to Z (UC and LC).

WHeel5 =====> yes 
_3wheel=====> Yes
Wheel3& ====> No
