Example 1: Write a Trigger on the Account object to make Phone field mandatory?
trigger AccountTrigger on Account(before insert){
    List<Account> lstacc = Trigger.New;
    for(Account acc : lstacc){
        if(acc.Phone == Null){
            acc.phone.addError('Phone number is Mandatory for every new record creation');
        }
    }
}

Example 2:Write a Trigger on the Account object, If Phone is not Null and Fax is Null then get the Phone value into Fax field?
trigger AccountTrigger on Account(before update){
    for(Account acc:Trigger.new){
        if(acc.Phone != Null && acc.Fax== Null){
            acc.fax = acc.phone;
        }
    }
}

Example3: Write a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts? 
trigger AccountTrigger on Account(before delete){
    //Step1: Get the Account Id and Account details in which you are going to delete and store it in OldMap (because those are existing records)
    Map<id,Account> oldAccMap = Trigger.oldMap;
    //Step2: Now write a SOQL query and get all the Account Keys in which you want to delete and along with its related Cases
    List<Account> lstacc1 = [Select id,Name, (Select id, caseNumber from Cases) from Account Where id IN : oldAccMap.keyset()];
    //Step3:Convert the above list into Map (and try to get Account Id and List of cases )
    Map<id,list<case>> mapofAccCases = new Map<id,list<case>>();
    //Step4:Now convert the list into Map and store Account Id's  as key and List<cases> as values which are related to the Account
    for(Account ac:lstacc1){
        mapofAccCases.put(ac.id,ac.cases);
    }
    //Step5: Now get all the records in which you are going to delete.
    for(Account acc:Trigger.old){
        //if the above map contains account id's
        if(mapofAccCases.containsKey(acc.Id)){
            //get those list of cases
            List<case> lstcases = mapofAccCases.get(acc.Id);
            //if the cases size is greater than zero then throw error
            if(lstcases.size()>0){
                acc.addError('You cannot delete Accounts if cases exist');
            }
        }
    }
}

   
Example : Get all the above 3 triggers and store it in the single Trigger class.
In simple format ::
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    if(trigger.isBefore && (trigger.isInsert ||trigger.isupdate)){
        //copy code:Write a Trigger on the Account object to make Phone field mandatory?
        //copy code:Write a Trigger on the Account object, If Phone is not Null and Fax is Null then get the Phone value into Fax field?
    }
    if(Trigger.isBefore && trigger.isdelete){
        //copy code:Write a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts? 
    }
}

In detail format ::
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    if(trigger.isBefore && (trigger.isInsert ||trigger.isupdate)){
        List<Account> lstacc = Trigger.New;
        for(Account acc : lstacc){
            if(acc.Phone == Null){
                acc.phone.addError('Phone number is Mandatory for every new record creation');
            }
        }
        for(Account acc:Trigger.new){
            if(acc.Phone != Null && acc.Fax== Null){
                acc.fax = acc.phone;
            }
        }
        
    }
    if(Trigger.isBefore && trigger.isdelete){
        //Step1: Get the Account Id and Account details in which you are going to delete and store it in OldMap (because those are existing records)
        Map<id,Account> oldAccMap = Trigger.oldMap;
        //Step2: Now write a SOQL query and get all the Account Keys in which you want to delete and along with its related Cases
        List<Account> lstacc1 = [Select id,Name, (Select id, caseNumber from Cases) from Account Where id IN : oldAccMap.keyset()];
        //Step3:Convert the above list into Map (and try to get Account Id and List of cases )
        Map<id,list<case>> mapofAccCases = new Map<id,list<case>>();
        //Step4:Now convert the list into Map and store Account Id's  as key and List<cases> as values which are related to the Account
        for(Account ac:lstacc1){
            mapofAccCases.put(ac.id,ac.cases);
        }
        //Step5: Now get all the records in which you are going to delete.
        for(Account acc:Trigger.old){
            //if the above map contains account id's
            if(mapofAccCases.containsKey(acc.Id)){
                //get those list of cases
                List<case> lstcases = mapofAccCases.get(acc.Id);
                //if the cases size is greater than zero then throw error
                if(lstcases.size()>0){
                    acc.addError('You cannot delete Accounts if cases exist');
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Q)3.Writter a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts?
trigger AccountTrigger3 on Account (before delete) {
    for(Account acc : Trigger.old){
        List<Case> lstCases = [SELECT id, CaseNumber FROM Case WHERE accountId =: acc.id];
        if(lstCases.size()>0){
            acc.addError('You cant delete account if cases already exist');
        }
    }
}
Note: The above solution will also work but we should never write SOQL quiries inside the for loop and also for suppose you are attempting to delete 200 records while
using data loader, from the above code for loop will execute 100 times because limit 100 SOQL and it will hit the governor limit.

                                                        
                                                        Trigger Best Practices
Note: 
a.If you look at the above Trigger, we are writting complete logic in the trigger itself which is not a good practice.
b.One Trigger One Object.
c.Always create logic less Trigger(Create helper class for each trigger and put your logic in Helper class and call helper class in the Trigger).

Example: Now write the same above Trigger using best pratices.

Steps:
    a.Create a Class
    b.Create seperate methods
            i.phoneValidation(list<Account> lstNewAccs)
            ii.UpdateFax(list<Account> lstNewAccs)
            iii.accountDeletion(list<Account> lstOldAccs, Map<id,oldAccMap)
     c.Make necessary modification in the Trigger.

public class AccountTriggerHelper {
    //Q)1.Write a Trigger on the Account object to make Phone field mandatory?
    public void phoneValidation(list<Account> lstNewAccs){
        for(Account acc : lstNewAccs){
            if(acc.Phone == Null){
                acc.phone.addError('Phone number is Mandatory for every new record creation');
            }
        }
    }
    //Q)2.Write a Trigger on the Account object, If Phone is not Null and Fax is Null then get the Phone value under Fax field?
    public void updateFax(list<Account> lstNewAccs){
        for(Account acc:lstNewAccs){
            if(acc.Phone != Null && acc.Fax== Null){
                acc.fax = acc.phone;
            }
        }
    }
    //Q)3.Writter a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts?
    public void accountDeletion(List<Account> lstOldAccs,Map<id,Account> olaAccMaps){
        //Step1: Get the Account Id and Account details in which you are going to delete and store it in OldMap (because those are existing records)
        Map<id,Account> oldAccMap = olaAccMaps;
        //Step2: Now write a SOQL query and get all the Account Keys in which you want to delete and along with its related Cases
        List<Account> lstacc1 = [Select id,Name, (Select id, caseNumber from Cases) from Account Where id IN : oldAccMap.keyset()];
        //Step3:Convert the above list into Map (and try to get Account Id and List of cases )
        Map<id,list<case>> mapofAccCases = new Map<id,list<case>>();
        //Step4:Now convert the list into Map and store Account Id's and List<cases> related to the Account
        for(Account ac:lstacc1){
            mapofAccCases.put(ac.id,ac.cases);
        }
        for(Account acc:lstOldAccs){
            if(mapofAccCases.containsKey(acc.Id)){
                List<case> lstcases = mapofAccCases.get(acc.Id);
                if(lstcases.size()>0){
                    acc.addError('You cannot delete Accounts if cases exist');
                }
            }
        }
    }
