                                                                        -----------------------
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    if(trigger.isBefore && (trigger.isInsert ||trigger.isupdate)){
        //Q)1.Write a Trigger on the Account object to make Phone field mandatory?
        List<Account> lstacc = Trigger.New;
        for(Account acc : lstacc){
            if(acc.Phone == Null){
                acc.phone.addError('Phone number is Mandatory for every new record creation');
            }
        }
        //Q)2.Write a Trigger on the Account object, If Phone is not Null and Fax is Null then get the Phone value under Fax field?
        for(Account acc:Trigger.new){
            if(acc.Phone != Null && acc.Fax== Null){
                acc.fax = acc.phone;
            }
        }
    }
    if(Trigger.isBefore && trigger.isdelete){
        //Q)3.Writter a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts?
        //Step1: Get the Account Id and Account details in which you are going to delete and store it in OldMap (because those are existing records)
        Map<id,Account> oldAccMap = Trigger.oldMap;
        //Step2: Now write a SOQL query and get all the Account Keys in which you want to delete and along with its related Cases
        List<Account> lstacc1 = [Select id,Name, (Select id, caseNumber from Cases) from Account Where id IN : oldAccMap.keyset()];
        //Step3:Convert the above list into Map (and try to get Account Id and List of cases )
        Map<id,list<case>> mapofAccCases = new Map<id,list<case>>();
        //Step4:Now convert the list into Map and store Account Id's and List<cases> related to the Account
        for(Account ac:lstacc1){
            mapofAccCases.put(ac.id,ac.cases);
        }
        for(Account acc:Trigger.old){
            if(mapofAccCases.containsKey(acc.Id)){
                List<case> lstcases = mapofAccCases.get(acc.Id);
                if(lstcases.size()>0){
                    acc.addError('You cannot delete Accounts if cases exist');
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Q)3.Writter a Trigger on Account, If Account has cases associated to it then do not delete those Accounts?
trigger AccountTrigger3 on Account (before delete) {
    for(Account acc : Trigger.old){
        List<Case> lstCases = [SELECT id, CaseNumber FROM Case WHERE accountId =: acc.id];
        if(lstCases.size()>0){
            acc.addError('You cant delete account if cases already exist');
        }
    }
}
Note: The above solution will also work but we should never write SOQL quiries inside the for loop and also for suppose you are attempting to delete 200 records while
using data loader, from the above code for loop will execute 100 times because limit 100 SOQL and it will hit the governor limit
